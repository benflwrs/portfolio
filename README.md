# Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my portfolio website

It's a static React Application.

## Content

I retrieve markdown from the public folder as well as images to create the layout of the site.
This allows me to easily adjust the content without changing the source code.

## Deployment

I used gh-pages to easily deploy the application to github
